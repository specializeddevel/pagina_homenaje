          was an Argentine inventor, educator, and cardiothoracic surgeon,
          internationally recognized for developing coronary artery bypass
          grafting using the great saphenous vein.
        </p>
        <p>
          He studied medicine at the National University of La Plata, where he
          graduated with a thesis on ileus. Once he received his degree, he
          temporarily replaced the local physician in Jacinto Arauz, who was in
          poor health. He also studied up-to-date medical literature and
          developed an interest in thoracic surgery. In the late 1960s, at the
          Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, he began studying a technique for using the
          saphenous vein in coronary surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1971, he returned to Argentina to work at the Güemes private
          sanatorium, thanks to his friend, interventional cardiologist Dr. Luis
          de la Fuente, who proposed and convinced him to come back. In the
          early 1970s, he founded the Favaloro Foundation, at the suggestion of
          Dr. De la Fuente.
